# Figures for tACS review article
Use of matplotlib library in Python. This library was used to create figures for inclusion in a review article on the effect of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). 

As a sinusoidal wave is plotted over time, Numpy was used both its convenient and efficient calculations and ability to create an array of time, i.e. from 0 to 1
seconds plotted at resolution of 10 milliseconds.

**Future Versions**
Will aim to employ interactive plot using plotly that allows the user to specify the frequency and amplitude of different signals to plot for them.

## Required libraries
